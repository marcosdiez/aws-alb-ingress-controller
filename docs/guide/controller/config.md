# ALB Ingress Controller Configuration
This document covers configuration of the ALB ingress controller

## AWS API Access
To perform operations, the controller must have required IAM role capabilities for accessing and
provisioning ALB resources. There are many ways to achieve this, such as loading `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables or using [kube2iam](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam).

A sample IAM policy, with the minimum permissions to run the controller, can be found in [alb-iam-policy.json](../../examples/iam-policy.json).

## Setting Ingress Resource Scope
You can limit the ingresses ALB ingress controller controls by combining following two approaches:

### Limiting ingress class
Setting the `--ingress-class` argument constrains the controller's scope to ingresses with matching `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation.
This is especially helpful when running multiple ingress controllers in the same cluster. See [Using Multiple Ingress Controllers](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/master/examples/multiple-ingress-controllers#using-multiple-ingress-controllers) for more details.

An example of the container spec portion of the controller, only listening for resources with the class "alb", would be as follows.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - --ingress-class=alb
```

Now, only ingress resources with the appropriate annotation are picked up, as seen below.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: echoserver
  namespace: echoserver
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb"
spec:
    ...
```

### Limiting Namespaces
Setting the `--watch-namespace` argument constrains the controller's scope to a single namespace. Ingress events outside of the namespace specified are not be seen by the controller.

An example of the container spec, for a controller watching only the `default` namespace, is as follows.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - --watch-namespace=default
```

> Currently, you can set only 1 namespace to watch in this flag. See [this Kubernetes issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/847) for more details.

## Limiting External Namespaces

Setting the `--restrict-scheme` boolean flag to `true` will enable the ALB controller to check the configmap named `alb-ingress-controller-internet-facing-ingresses` for a list of approved ingresses before provisioning ALBs with an internet-facing scheme. Here is an example of that ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
 mynamespace: my-ingress-name, my-ingress-name-2
 myothernamespace: my-other-ingress-name
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: alb-ingress-controller-internet-facing-ingresses
```

This ConfigMap is kept in `default` if unspecified, and can be overridden via the `--restrict-scheme-namespace` flag.

## Resource Tags

Setting the `--default-tags` command line argument adds arbitrary tags to ALBs and target groups managed by the ingress controller.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /server
    - --default-tags=mykey=myvalue,otherkey=othervalue
```

## Subnet Auto Discovery
You can tag AWS subnets to allow ingress controller auto discover subnets used for ALBs.

- `kubernetes.io/cluster/${cluster-name}` must be set to `owned` or `shared`. Remember `${cluster-name}` needs to be the same name you're passing to the controller in the `--cluster-name` option

- `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb` must be set to `1` or `` for internal LoadBalancers

- `kubernetes.io/role/elb` must be set to `1` or `` for internet-facing LoadBalancers

An example of a subnet with the correct tags for the cluster `joshcalico` is as follows:

## Using only one Load Balancer

There is an experimental way to use only one ALB for the whole kubernetes cluster.
This ALB can every already exist and have other rules not managed by `aws-alb-ingress-controller`.
In order to do so, use the `--force-alb-name` command line argument.

Here is how a part of `alb-ingress-controller.yaml` should look like:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /server
    - --force-alb-name=k8salb
```

There are some caveats in using this:

- It is still experimental
- Since only 50 rules are allowed per ALB, bad this will happen if you need more rules
- It currently only *adds*  and *modifies* rules, but do not delete any. This causes two consequences:
  - One can manually add rules to the load balancer and it will not mind.
  - Deleted k8s resources will leave dangling rules, that should be manually deleted.

The fact that dangling rules must be manually deleted is a known issue that will be addressed in the future.
